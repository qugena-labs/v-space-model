GOAL OF PAPER: showcase small scale application of multidimensions/parameter computations for increased usaged in wider applications.

- interdependence of 4 parameter fields inside a register
        - How do we have non 1 and 0 results for the parameter? how will we create superposition/entanglement between values using this?




##LATER NOT RIGHT NOW
Qubits used as bloch sphere to represent values
-> the quantum gates is what makes using qubits unique and interactions between them meaningful [specifically entanglement and superposition of positions/angle superpositions?]
-> what do |0> and |1> mean????
